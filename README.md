* The Personal ID will also be used to pull data to create a bar graph of the top ten most populous bacteria found in that person's belly button. </br>
* The Personal ID is also used to create a Bubble Chart of all of the bacteria showing the amounts of each type. </br>
* Lastly, the Personal ID is used to create a Gauge of how many times per week the person washes their belly button.
